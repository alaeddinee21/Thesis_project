# Thesis_project
This repository presents an AI agent designed to analyze and prioritize qualitative user feedback using agentic reasoning and large language models. Built as part of a masterâ€™s thesis in data science, the agent goes beyond traditional ML and NLP methods by dynamically interpreting feedback in context,  for product and marketing teams.
