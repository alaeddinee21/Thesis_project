 # Agentic Feedback Analyzer

This repository contains the implementation and design logic of an Agentic AI system developed as part of a thesis exploring the next generation of feedback analysis tools. The system leverages cutting-edge language models (LLMs) to categorize and prioritize qualitative user feedback in real-time, providing strategic insights for product and marketing teams.

## üß† Core Objective

Traditional feedback analysis methods (e.g., ML classifiers, rule-based NLP, sentiment scoring) often fall short in delivering nuanced and actionable business intelligence. This AI agent aims to overcome those limitations by embedding reasoning, adaptability, and contextual understanding into the analysis pipeline.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Agentic Architecture**: A modular reasoning loop allowing dynamic task planning, memory usage, and self-correction.
- **LLM-Powered Categorization**: Semantic classification of feedback using advanced LLMs (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, ChatGPT, etc.).
- **Priority Scoring**: Multi-criteria prioritization of feedback based on urgency, relevance, and impact.
- **Zero-Shot & Few-Shot Capabilities**: No need for large training datasets ‚Äî the agent adapts to new domains quickly.
- **Interface Ready**: Designed for seamless integration with modern frontends (React/Vite stack).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion (Kappt prototype)
- **Agent Layer**: Reasoning & orchestration layer managing prompt flow, tools, and memory.
- **LLM Backend**: Gemini, OpenAI, or custom adapters.
- **Output**: Structured insights in JSON/CSV formats, ready for dashboards or API consumption.

## üéØ Use Case

Developed as a part of a master‚Äôs thesis at the Higher School of Statistics and Applied Economics, this project addresses a key business challenge: how to extract strategic value from messy, unstructured feedback data at scale.
